                  It is never too late to follow your dreams and passion and
                  this Bangalore couple did just that. Nidhi Singh and her
                  husband, Shikhar Veer Singh, left their high-paying jobs and
                  even sold their house to start selling samosas. Now, the idea
                  could have been laughed at or frowned upon initially, but
                  Nidhi and Shikhar are having the last laugh as they are
                  smiling their way to the bank. They are earning more than
                  their jobs would have ever paid them.Their business has grown
                  manifold in a couple of years. At this juncture, their
                  company's annual turnover was Rs 45 crore.

                  When the world was grappling with COVID-19, Rishabh Gupta was
                  working with the Mashreq Bank in Dubai after completing his
                  engineering in Computer Science. When loneliness in a faraway
                  land hit him, he came back home. His Delhi-based parents,
                  Rashmi and Rakesh Arya, had also moved to their hometown in
                  Shamsabad, Agra (Uttar Pradesh) during the lockdown. “After
                  coming home, I decided not to go back again. I wanted to
                  pursue something here, and organic farming was one of the
                  options since our family owns around 3 acres of land here in
                  Shamsabad,” says 27-year-old Rishabh. Around the same time,
                  his younger brother Ayush Gupta completed his BBA from the
                  University of London and returned to India. The two brothers
                  took online training on vegetable farming at the Centre of
                  Excellence for Vegetables, Gharaunda (Karnal). It is an
                  Indo-Israel Project approved by the Ministry of Agriculture.
